# Duality
Duality is a result of GlobalGameJam2017. The theme was "Waves". We thought about the wave-particle-dualism. If the light is at state wave it will behave in another way as if it is in state particle. One needs to rotate glas, mirror, wall and water elements so that the light will hit the target in the needed state. There are also target that can be "lighted" by waves and particle. The level is done if all target are "lighted". I will describe all of the game elements separatly now.

## Element: Glas
Glas is letting through waves but is reflecting particles.

## Element: Mirror
Mirrors get destroyed by particles and reflect waves. The particles will just fly through and left a destroyed mirror.

## Element: Wall
Wall do reflect particles but absorb waves.

## Element: 


We developed the release v1.0.1-ggj17 between about 11am on Saturday and 5pm on Sunday.
